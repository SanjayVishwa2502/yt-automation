Phase 1: Project Setup and Idea Generation
The first step is to set up the foundation of your project and create a system for generating video ideas.

Cloud Platform Setup: You'll need a cloud platform to host and run your automated workflow. Popular choices include Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure. These platforms offer "serverless" services, which means you can run your code without managing any servers.

Trend Collection Model: To collect recent trends, you can use APIs from Google Trends, Twitter, or other social media platforms. You can write a script (e.g., in Python) that runs on a schedule (e.g., once a day) using a serverless function (like Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda, or Azure Functions).

Idea Generation and Storage: Once you have the trending topics, you can feed them into a large language model (LLM) like Gemini to generate video ideas. These ideas can then be automatically saved to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API.

Phase 2: Content Generation (Prompts and Scripts)
Now that you have ideas, you need to turn them into prompts for your video generation model.

Prompt Generation Model: You can use another LLM to take the video ideas from your Google Sheet and generate detailed prompts suitable for a video generation model like Google Veo.

Handling Video Length: As you mentioned, Google Veo generates short video clips (around 8 seconds). To create a 20-40 second video, you'll need to generate multiple prompts for a single video idea, each describing a different scene or a continuation of the previous one.

Phase 3: Video Creation and Assembly
This is where your video comes to life.

Video Generation with Google Veo: You'll use the Google Veo API to generate video clips from the prompts you created in the previous phase. You will need to make API calls for each prompt to get the video clips.

Video Assembly: Once you have all the video clips for a single video, you'll need a way to stitch them together. You can use a cloud-based video editing API or a library like FFmpeg running on a serverless function to combine the clips into a single video file. You can also add background music or a voiceover at this stage.

Phase 4: Metadata Generation and Storage
A good video needs a good title, description, and tags to be discovered.

Metadata Generation: You can use an LLM to generate catchy titles, detailed descriptions, and relevant tags for your video. You can even provide the model with the video's script or a summary of its content to get more accurate metadata.

Database Storage: Instead of another Google Sheet, consider using a more robust database like Google's Firestore or Amazon's DynamoDB to store the generated videos and their metadata. This will make it easier to build a mobile app for reviewing and managing your content.

Phase 5: Automation and Deployment
This is where you connect all the pieces to create a seamless, automated workflow.

Workflow Orchestration: You can use a service like Google Cloud Workflows, AWS Step Functions, or Azure Logic Apps to connect all the different steps of your process. This will allow you to create a visual workflow where the output of one step automatically triggers the next.

Scheduling: You can schedule your entire workflow to run a certain number of times per day (e.g., twice a day) to meet your goal of uploading at least two videos daily.

Phase 6: Review and Upload
The final step is to review the generated content and upload it to your YouTube channel.

Mobile Review App: You can build a simple mobile application that connects to your database and allows you to review the generated videos and their metadata. This will give you the final say before a video goes live.

YouTube API for Uploading: Once you approve a video, your mobile app can trigger a final serverless function that uses the YouTube Data API to upload the video to your channel with the generated title, description, and tags.

By following these steps, you can build a powerful, fully automated system that creates and uploads videos to your YouTube channel, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of your content.
