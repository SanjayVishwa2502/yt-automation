Of course. Let's focus exclusively on Phase 1 and break it down into a detailed, step-by-step action plan.

This phase is all about setting up your foundation and automating the process of generating video ideas. We can split it into three main parts: setting up your cloud environment, collecting trend data, and generating and storing the ideas.

Part A: Cloud Environment Setup
This is the one-time setup to create the "home" for your project in the cloud.

Step 1: Choose and Create a Cloud Account:

Decide on a cloud provider. Since you plan to use Google Veo and Sheets, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is the most logical choice.

Go to the Google Cloud website and create an account. You'll likely need a Google account and a credit card for verification, but they have a generous free tier.

Step 2: Create a New Project:

Inside your GCP console, create a new, dedicated project. Name it something clear like YouTube-Automation-Project. This keeps all your services and billing organized.

Step 3: Install the Command Line Tool:

Download and install the gcloud CLI (Command Line Interface). This tool lets you manage your GCP project from your computer's terminal, which is much faster for deploying code.

Step 4: Enable Required APIs:

In the GCP console, go to the "APIs & Services" library. You need to search for and enable these specific APIs for your project:

Cloud Functions API

Cloud Scheduler API

Google Sheets API

Google Drive API

Vertex AI API (this gives you access to the Gemini model for idea generation)

Part B: Automated Trend Data Collection
Here, we'll build the part that automatically finds what's popular.

Step 5: Create a Service Account:

Go to the "IAM & Admin" section and create a Service Account. This acts as a secure, non-human user that your scripts will use to interact with Google services. Name it something like youtube-automation-bot.

Grant it basic roles like "Editor" for now.

Create and download a JSON key file for this service account. Treat this file like a password and keep it secure!

Step 6: Write the Trend-Fetching Script:

On your computer, set up a Python environment. You'll need to install a library for Google Trends. A popular one is pytrends. You can install it by running pip install pytrends.

Write a Python script that uses this library to fetch the top trending daily searches for a region (e.g., 'IN' for India).

Test the script on your computer to make sure it successfully prints a list of trending topics.

Step 7: Deploy the Trend-Fetching Function:

Convert your script into a Cloud Function. This means placing your code inside a main function that GCP can trigger.

Use the gcloud CLI to deploy this function to your project. This function, when triggered, will run in the cloud, fetch the trends, and then stop.

Step 8: Schedule the Function:

Go to the Cloud Scheduler in your GCP console.

Create a new job that is scheduled to trigger your trend-fetching Cloud Function automatically. You can set the frequency to "daily" and choose a specific time (e.g., 8:00 AM every morning).

Part C: Idea Generation and Storage
Finally, let's turn those trends into video ideas and save them.

Step 9: Prepare Your Google Sheet:

Create a new Google Sheet.

Set up columns like: Date, Trending Topic, Generated Idea, and Status.

Find the client email address in the JSON key file you downloaded in Step 5.

Share your Google Sheet with this email address and give it "Editor" permissions.

Step 10: Write the Idea Generation Script:

Write a second Python script. You will need to install libraries for interacting with Google's services: pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib gspread.

This script should be able to:

Take a trending topic as an input.

Send that topic to the Gemini API with a prompt like, "Generate a 20-second YouTube video idea based on this trend: [trending topic]".

Use the gspread library and your service account's JSON key to connect to your Google Sheet.

Write the current date, the original topic, and the idea from Gemini into a new row.

Step 11: Deploy the Idea Generation Function:

Just like before, convert this second script into its own Cloud Function and deploy it to GCP.

Step 12: Connect Everything:

Modify your first Cloud Function (the trend-fetcher). Instead of just stopping after getting the trends, it should now call your second Cloud Function (the idea-generator) for each trend it found.

Once you complete these 12 steps, you will have a fully automated system that, every day, finds the top trends, generates a unique video idea for each one, and neatly organizes them in a Google Sheet for you, all without you lifting a finger. ðŸš€
